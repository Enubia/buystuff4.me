              Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
              Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new

              Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but itâ€™s actually our
              duty to future generations.

              Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
              called a pilot.<br />
              <br />
              Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the
              strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make
              more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television
              programs.Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the
              ones that became nothing.

              This is not about revenge. This is about justice. A lot of things
              can change in twelve years, Admiral. Well, that's certainly good
              to know. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I
              looked.

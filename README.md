# Welcome to buystuff4.me

Always wanted that one item from amazon but couldn't afford it? Or are you in a poor financial situation and need an
item super urgent? Look no further. At buystuff4.me you'll be able to list your public amazon wishlist, categorize it
and get donations from generous strangers.

We are open source and not affiliated with any company out there (looking at you amazon). Logins are done via OAuth so
no need to worry about your data. We only store your email, first- and lastname for the listings (as well as your
wishlist links of course).

### Project status

Right now it's in the beginning phase but a lot of motivation/coffee to ship this site ASAP is already present.
